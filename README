## Introduction

Energy consumption prediction plays a crucial role in optimizing resource allocation and ensuring future energy needs are met. This project employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict future energy consumption values based on past data. The goal is to train a model on historical energy data and generate forecasts for future energy usage.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to install the required Python libraries. The primary dependencies include:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For preprocessing, including scaling the data.
- **tensorflow**: For constructing and training the LSTM model.

### Steps for Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energy-consumption-prediction.git
    cd energy-consumption-prediction
    ```

2. Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure that the dataset (`dataset_final.csv`) is placed in the correct directory or adjust the file path in the code accordingly.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical energy consumption data for various states in India. Each row represents the energy consumption for a specific day, and the columns include:
- `Unnamed: 0`: The date of the energy reading.
- Energy consumption values for each state (e.g., `Punjab`, `Haryana`, `Delhi`).

The data is processed to include temporal features like the day, month, year, and weekday, and additional engineered features such as seasonality and weekend information.

## Code Walkthrough

### Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing step is essential to clean and transform the raw data into a format suitable for training the model. Key preprocessing tasks include:
- **Date Parsing**: Convert the `Unnamed: 0` column into a `datetime` object.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract features such as the day of the week, month, year, and create additional features like whether the day is a weekend.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Transform categorical features (like `Season`) into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Any rows with missing values are dropped to ensure the model doesn't learn from incomplete data.

### Data Visualization

Before training the model, visualizations help us understand the patterns in energy consumption. Key visualizations include:
- Line plots showing raw energy consumption over time for each state.
- Rolling averages to smooth fluctuations and reveal long-term trends.

These plots help in identifying patterns, such as seasonal trends or sudden spikes in energy consumption.

### Model Training

The LSTM model is built to forecast future energy consumption. The model consists of:
- **LSTM Layers**: These layers are designed to handle time-series data. The model includes multiple LSTM layers, with units configured to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Dense Layers**: These layers follow the LSTM layers and are used for the final prediction.
- **Compilation and Training**: The model is compiled with an Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function. It is trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn patterns in historical energy consumption.

### Prediction

Once trained, the model can be used to predict future energy consumption. The prediction process involves:
- Using the last `look_back` days of data as input to generate predictions for the next `steps` days.
- The output is a time-series of predicted energy consumption values.

## Model Performance

The performance of the model is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Provides the square of the error, emphasizing larger errors.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the MSE, offering an interpretable measure of prediction error in the same units as the data.

Visual comparison between predicted and actual values further helps assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

## Future Work

While the current model serves as a good starting point, there are several areas for improvement:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different LSTM architectures, batch sizes, and epochs to improve model performance.
2. **Incorporate More Features**: Integrate additional external factors (such as temperature, holidays, etc.) that could influence energy consumption.
3. **Advanced Models**: Explore more complex models like attention-based mechanisms, GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), or Transformer models for time-series prediction.
4. **Model Interpretability**: Use techniques like SHAP or LIME to understand which features contribute most to the modelâ€™s predictions.
